      <h2 class="loading">Welcome</h2>
      <p>My name is Thomas Bergendahl. I am a third-year honors student at the University of Connecticut, studying Computer Science
        and Engineering. I am interested in opportunities in Full-Stack development, Game Development, Web Development, and in developing and researching
        Machine Learning models. Check out some of my projects below! You can connect with me through my LinkedIn or by sending me an email at busntgbergendahl@gmail.com

        <h3>University Loaner Tracker</h3>

      <div class="description">
        <p>I am collaborating with a team to develop a page to track the status of all loaner laptops and iPads deployed
          by the university's ITS. My role in the project is leading the design and planning functionality for the page, as well as programming back-end
          development for the application. This process involved interfacing with Atlassian's REST API, which allows us to access the assets which have their data stored
          in an external cloud server. I developed this back-end data collection in Python, and this data was processed and used in the JavaScript front end implementation.

        <p>I designed and implemented an efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm to draw a convex hull (smallest polygon that contains all points)
          around a set of points in a 2D plane. I also provided some documentation for its proof and time complexity analysis.</p>
